# Starter bots
Entelect will provide starter bots for the following languages:

* .Net Core (C#)
* Python 
* Javascript
* Java

Starter bots are the bare essentials you need to get going with very little decision making capability. They are built to be able to read in game files and make a random move.

The reference bot on the other hand is capable of playing a game from start to finish with some cleverness built in. This is there to help contestants who want something a bit smarter to work from.

Once your starter bot and docker container has been created. Create a pull request on github with the starter bot as well as the relevant docker container.
If you require any assistance building the continers please feel free to contact us at challenge@entelect.co.za.
